// It also carries the Jingles rank, and that is on purpose rather than for
// convenience. Jack asked for the Lab 300 rank to be visible anywhere a
// player's value is shown, and a player's value is shown in about ten places:
// rosters, the trade builder, the draft board, recommendations, search, the
// plan. Adding a chip to each of those is ten chances for the next surface to
// be built without one. This is the one component all of them already go
// through, so a new page gets it for free.
//
// The league comes from the URL rather than a prop. Every caller already
// renders inside /l/[leagueId], and threading the id through dozens of call
// sites would buy nothing.
